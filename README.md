# DL-Sentiment-Score

I used LSTMs to do fine-grained sentiment classification in order to "score" Columbia University professor reviews written by students.

I trained the model using data from the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-5). 
My model reached around 48.5% testing accuracy (state of art is BERT's 55.5%).
